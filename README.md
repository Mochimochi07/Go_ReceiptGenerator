# Go_ReceiptGenerator
a simple Receipt generator using Go

This is my simple Receipt Generator.

Yeah, i always thought of how receipts work though its not the best thing that i can imagine but it can be used as a starting point.

too bad i wanted to make a personal receipt generator since its a crud app.

Well, i think im into systems programming for a while and im getting the hang of it. 

i kinda like it so much but im always thinking of learning other language rather than go.
